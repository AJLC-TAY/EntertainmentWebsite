          |       We are merely Kpop fans and admire Big Hit Entertainment. As a group of students studying Information Technology, we have desired to maximize Big Hit songs and advocacies. By creating a site that provides information and services like displaying their music and news about them.We want to help broaden their audience to spread their advocacies and love for music.
